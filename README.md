# RenderTextureTest
Reproduce RenderTexture problem

Open `index.html` in a http server. You'll see a phaser window. Use left/right key to move the canvas, and up/down to zoom the camera.
Scale down the camera, you will see that the renderTexture has the same size as the game window, not what we expected.
